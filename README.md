# Project Yellow Ghost

## What is Project Yellow Ghost?
A [product](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/) developed by [Jonathan Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonny-wang-16993b135/). The purpose of this project is to prove web apps have the potential to act just like a native on a typical smart phone. For this project, we chose to clone the popular app [Snap Chat](https://www.snapchat.com/). We believe web apps have the potential to be just as powerful as native apps with today's current technology. For instance, updating apps is a big deal when installing on a device. But with web apps, there is no need to install or update. The user just has to load the site and they're in! To test out the product, [click here](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/). To read more on how it all start, feel free to read this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/project-yellow-ghost-jonny-wang/?trackingId=ozYcbmMms1OI4BU1ALkPQA%3D%3D). 

# Installation
None! Just [click here](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/) to start using the product!

# Usage
### General
Due to time budget, there are only two app views instead of three. A camera and messages view.
### Camera View
The main stage. The place to take pictures from your device's camera and send them to yourself or friends on the platform.
### Messages View
This is where the user will see snaps from friends and yourself.
### Accounts
Login pages are annoying. So we decided to create guest accounts the moment the user loads into the web app. You can start using the product immediately without signing in. If you like it, you can sign in with Google and an account will get created for you automatically. No mess, no fuss.

# Contributing
This is a project showcasing the amount of potential web apps have and was completed within two weeks. Feel free to make any pull requests to make this web app feel like Snap Chat.
