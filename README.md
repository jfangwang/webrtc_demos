## What is Project Yellow Ghost?
A [product](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/) developed by [Jonathan Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonny-wang-16993b135/). The purpose of this project is to prove web apps have the potential to act just like a native on a typical smart phone. For this project, we chose to clone the popular app [Snap Chat](https://www.snapchat.com/). We believe web apps have the potential to be just as powerful as native apps with today's current technology. For instance, updating apps is a big deal when installing on a device. But with web apps, there is no need to install or update. The user just has to load the site and they're in! To test out the product, [click here](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/). To read more on how it all start, feel free to read this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/project-yellow-ghost-jonny-wang/?trackingId=ozYcbmMms1OI4BU1ALkPQA%3D%3D). 

## Installation
None! Just [click here](https://project-yellow-ghost.firebaseapp.com/) to start using the product!

## How it was built
In order for this project to be like the native app, it has to be a single page application. This means no more refreshing or page re-directs. Everything has to be processed on the same screen otherwise it would ruin the experience. This is not a regular website, it is an attempt to make an app on the web.
### Front-end
React JS -  The framework that will achieve the SPA concept and has many other packages that are useful for UI enhancements. Used JSX for ease of use. This framework was chosen due to it's ability to show dynamic content and has a large community which means forums are everywhere relating to React JS

### Backend
Firebase - This is the database currently being used right now. It was chosen primarily it had everything spanning from web hosting to database hosting to system metrics. Firebase is owned and maintained by Google which means this is a reliable database to use and has a lot of other features not listed here containing potential to expand this project.


## Usage
### General
Due to time budget, there are only two app views instead of three. A camera and messages view.
### Camera View
The main stage. The place to take pictures from your device's camera and send them to yourself or friends on the platform.
### Messages View
This is where the user will see snaps from friends and yourself.
### Accounts
Login pages are annoying. So we decided to create guest accounts the moment the user loads into the web app. You can start using the product immediately without signing in. If you like it, you can sign in with Google and an account will get created for you automatically. No mess, no fuss.

## What's Next?
As of June 18th 2021, this project has a working messages and camera view with basic features. We currently have plans to keep working on this project to make this web app feel closer to the native app. In the near future, we plan to add a bunch of more features that are not present such as animations, filters, text messaging system, record video and more! Keep an eye out on this project and will continue to update this project.

## Contributing
This is a project showcasing the amount of potential web apps have and was completed within two weeks. Feel free to make any pull requests to make this web app feel like Snap Chat.
