        <h1>What are messages?</h1>
        <p>Messages is a place where a user will receive snaps from other users on the platform. We are currently working on a friends list feature and hope to release soon!</p>

      <div class="user">
        <h1>Where can I view my messages?</h1>
        <p>You can view your messages on any device that can run a browser. This means you can send a photo from your phone and see it on your computer!</p>

          <h1>When does the photo get deleted from servers?</h1>
          <p>The original photo gets deleted after the last person on your sent list sees the photo.</p>

        <div class="user">
          <h1>Why are some photos look too big or too small?</h1>
          <p>We adjust the photo to the best size for your device. Sometimes we just can't adjust the photo otherwise it would look weird. This is a feature we are currently working on.</p>

        <h1>Inspiration for Project Yellow Ghost</h1>
        <p>As a holberton student studying full stack development, I was naturally interested in web apps and wondered about the possible potential they had as the hardware on every device progressed. One day I read an article stating apps could one day be obsolete and be transitioned to webapps. This got me thinking. Could this replace native apps soon? The main advantage would be bypassing installations/updates and would be available to any device that can open a web browser. Then I recently discovered Webrtc has the power to access a deviceâ€™s camera and mic from a web browser and wondered if SnapChat as a webapp could be possible. How close can this SnapChat web app be to the native app? Would it be able to have the same performance compared to the app running on a phone? For example: Are notifications possible when running the web app in the background on a smartphone? If this is possible, this could lead to a movement of transitioning from apps to webapps. I then started to do some serious research. I started making a project outline detailing the pros and cons of doing this project. The big question that kept coming back to me was: "Would it be good enough for people to switch over?"</p>
        <p>A month later, I decided to pursue this as my final project. I did all the research I could. I kneew which technology was best for this project. For example, I had to decide which framework would work best for this web app? It turns out I need a framework that would support Single Page Applications and React JS was the consensus amoung the forums. It made sense. React JS has the ability to render separate sections of a webpage really fast (aka components). A page refresh would ruin the entire experience for the user and knew React was the best option.</p>
        <p>Since the start of this project, I really cared about the user experience and wanted to make it look really good on desktop and mobile. It needed to be seamless and smooth for the user which means the web app has to adapt to whatever device the user was holding in their hands. This was a HUGE motivator for this project and was the top priority over anything else. If any new changes compromised the user experience on any device, I would have to refactor the code base to accomodate for the new change. The quality of the user experience has to be high otherwise it would defeat the purpose of this project.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind this project was completed from scratch in two weeks and have plans to maintain this project. I hope you enjoy the product.</p>
