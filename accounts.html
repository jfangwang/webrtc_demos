        <h1>I do not have an account</h1>
        <p>Not to worry! You can just start capturing photos without an account. A guest account automatically gets created for you so you can try it out before making an account. If you leave the page, the guest account will delete itself along with it's captured snaps. No harm, no foul.</p>

      <div class="user">
        <h1>I do have an account</h1>
        <p>Awesome! Project Yellow Ghost can automatically detect whether you are still signed in with us or not. If not, just click on the guest profile on the top left corner of the page and sign in with Google.</p>

    <div class="user">
      <h1>I want to create an account!</h1>
      <p>Yay! All you need is a Google account. You don't have to fill out any forms or do anything. Project Yellow Ghost relies on Google sign in to create a yellow ghost account. Just hit the 'guest profile' at the top left corner and a popup will appear prompting you to sign in with Google.</p>

        <h1>Inspiration for Project Yellow Ghost</h1>
        <p>As a holberton student studying full stack development, I was naturally interested in web apps and wondered about the possible potential they had as the hardware on every device progressed. One day I read an article stating apps could one day be obsolete and be transitioned to webapps. This got me thinking. Could this replace native apps soon? The main advantage would be bypassing installations/updates and would be available to any device that can open a web browser. Then I recently discovered Webrtc has the power to access a deviceâ€™s camera and mic from a web browser and wondered if SnapChat as a webapp could be possible. How close can this SnapChat web app be to the native app? Would it be able to have the same performance compared to the app running on a phone? For example: Are notifications possible when running the web app in the background on a smartphone? If this is possible, this could lead to a movement of transitioning from apps to webapps. I then started to do some serious research. I started making a project outline detailing the pros and cons of doing this project. The big question that kept coming back to me was: "Would it be good enough for people to switch over?"</p>
        <p>A month later, I decided to pursue this as my final project. I did all the research I could. I kneew which technology was best for this project. For example, I had to decide which framework would work best for this web app? It turns out I need a framework that would support Single Page Applications and React JS was the consensus amoung the forums. It made sense. React JS has the ability to render separate sections of a webpage really fast (aka components). A page refresh would ruin the entire experience for the user and knew React was the best option.</p>
        <p>Since the start of this project, I really cared about the user experience and wanted to make it look really good on desktop and mobile. It needed to be seamless and smooth for the user which means the web app has to adapt to whatever device the user was holding in their hands. This was a HUGE motivator for this project and was the top priority over anything else. If any new changes compromised the user experience on any device, I would have to refactor the code base to accomodate for the new change. The quality of the user experience has to be high otherwise it would defeat the purpose of this project.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind this project was completed from scratch in two weeks and have plans to maintain this project. I hope you enjoy the product.</p>
